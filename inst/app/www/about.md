# Generating Balanced Teams


## Background

Sometimes you've got a sports league with a bunch of awesome people that want 
to play together. In the process of administering the league, you need to put
all those awesome people on teams but how to best do it?


## Methodology 

The [`balancedteams` R package](https://github.com/apeterson91/balancedteams) 
(currently) uses a greedy algorithm that takes a player or group 
--- for players that baggage together --- score and assigns the "best" group to 
the worst performing team, starting with some random initialization of the 
teams. There are a number of ways to come up with this score but common
methods used by our collaborators include an average of a self-survey and/or
a captain's assessment of a player's athleticism. There are several things worth
noting here:

1. As far as I know there is no closed form solution to finding the "best"
partition of players into teams. This is what's known as a Non-Polynomial 
combinatorial optimization problem. Specifically, it is a variant of the 
[Bin-Packing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) problem.

  * That means that the parameter space is huge --- there are [N choose K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient) 
  possibilities for N players and K teams. Thus, we would run out of 
  memory/time if we tried to enumerate all possible team combinations for a 
  typical number of players and teams.

  * You can see a different methodology for solving this problem in 
  1-4 dimensional space [here](https://github.com/gyang274/gbp).
  
2. This work builds off of and is heavily inspired by the 
[Ann Arbor Ultimate](https://www.annarborultimate.org/)
league's [algorithm](https://github.com/a2ultimate/ultimate-league-app/blob/23af8dc1c3fdd985fab82530c1b7880c9ce7bb5c/src/ultimate/junta/views.py#L419) for assigning teams.

## Current Implementation

This app is currently a proof of concept, containing a basic UI to make the
greedy algorithm described above available to users, specifically the 
[Pittsburgh Ultimate League](https://pittsburgh-ultimate.org/). 
There is very little code setup to safeguard the user journey --- users beware! 
Future updates will likely add new functionality and safeguards.

### UI 

The user interface is fairly basic, consisting of 3 buttons and 1 slider 
to toggle. 

 * The "Player Template" button downloads a template of the kind of 
data the app can analyze. Currently this is a two column dataset with one 
column named "group_id" and a second named "group score". 

* The "Upload Player Data" button can be used to upload a csv file with data in the 
same structure as the template. Two tables will populate in the main panel
after the upload is complete. The first is a summary table containing the mean
scores of the teams generated by the algorithm. The second below the summary, 
is a searchable table containing all the team assignments.

* The "Number of Teams" slider can be used to toggle how many teams should be
created by the algorithm.

* Finally, the Generated Teams button can be used to download a csv of the
team assignments dataset.
